## Adding New Reports

The application is architected to support multiple report types. To add a new report:

1. Create a new model in the `Models` folder
2. Create a new report generator implementing `IReportGenerator<TConfig>`
3. Create a new Blazor page in `Components/Pages`
4. Add navigation link in `NavMenu.razor`

## Technologies Used

- **Blazor Web App**: Interactive server-side web framework
- **QuestPDF**: Modern PDF generation library
- **iText7**: PDF parsing and text extraction library
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI styling and components
- **.NET 9.0**: Latest .NET platform

## PDF Formatting Features

- Professional color scheme (Blue headers)
- Alternating row colors for better readability
- Proper spacing and margins
- Clear section headers
- Page numbering
- Responsive table layouts

## PDF Import Feature

The application includes an intelligent PDF import feature that dramatically reduces data entry time:

### How It Works

1. **Upload Last Month's Report**: Click the import button and select your previous month's PDF
2. **Automatic Text Extraction**: The system uses iText7 to extract all text content from the PDF
3. **Smart Pattern Matching**: Regular expressions identify and extract each metric value
4. **Intelligent Mapping**: Current period values become last period values for the new report
5. **Date Increment**: Report date automatically advances to the next month
6. **Ready to Use**: Form is pre-filled and ready for you to enter new current period data

### Benefits

- **Time Savings**: Reduces data entry by ~50% each month
- **Accuracy**: Eliminates transcription errors when copying previous month's data
- **Consistency**: Ensures all comparison values match the previous report exactly
- **Convenience**: No need to manually reference the old report

### Supported Fields

The PDF parser extracts:
- Company name and report metadata
- All iOS platform metrics (8 metrics Ã— 3 values each)
- Download source breakdown (5 sources Ã— 5 values each)
- All Android platform metrics (3 metrics Ã— 3 values each)
- Platform comparison data (4 categories Ã— 6 values each)
- Technical specifications

### Fallback Options

If PDF import doesn't work perfectly:
- Manually edit any incorrectly parsed fields
- Use the JSON export/import as an alternative
- Fill in the form manually from scratch
